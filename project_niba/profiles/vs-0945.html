        DESCRIPTION
        <br>
        Subject VS-0945 is a social young girl. She makes friends very
        <br>
        easily, and is always craving to talk to others. She wears
        <br>
        prescription glasses to help with her myopia, which she has had
        <br>
        since she was two (2) years old.
        <br>
        <br>
        TARGETED REGION AND EXPERIMENT PLAN
        <br>
        VS subject type. Goal of increasing the size of the occipital lobe
        <br>
        and other related areas to increase the subject's sensitivity to
        <br>
        visual stimuli. Other effects that improve vision are anticipated
        <br>
        to occur considering previous subjects of the same type. Subject
        <br>
        was chosen for her nearsightedness to see what improving a part of
        <br>
        the brain will do to other conditions not directly connected to
        <br>
        the brain.
