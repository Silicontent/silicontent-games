        DESCRIPTION
        <br>
        Subject PL-0002 is a young boy who loves to draw, write, and play.
        <br>
        However, he is very shy and tends to spend a lot of time alone.
        <br>
        Whenever he is told to participate in group activities, such as in
        <br>
        schools, his intelligence falters due to overwhelming stress and
        <br>
        uncomfortableness.
        <br>
        <br>
        TARGETED REGION AND EXPERIMENT PLAN
        <br>
        PL subject type. Goal of enlarging subject's frontal lobe to greatly
        <br>
        improve his critical thinking and planning skills. We think this will
        <br>
        be the best area to try to manipulate in PL-0002 because of his
        <br>
        natural intelligence and thinking skills. However, after the
        <br>
        catastrophic failure of PL-0001, the approach to PL-0002's experiment
        <br>
        needs to be handled with the utmost integrity.
