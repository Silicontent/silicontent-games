        <br>
        8 July 2008
        <br>
        A new subject has been brought in today. Our goal with this subject,
        <br>
        Subject VS-0945, is to increase their visual awareness. VS-0945 is an
        <br>
        eight year-old female with prescription glasses to help with their
        <br>
        visual impairment. After the last five failed experiments and
        <br>
        subsequent terminations of subjects HR-1438 and VS-0944, Mr.
        <br>
        [REDACTED] is threatening our department with discontinuation if the
        <br>
        next few experiments fail. To be completely honest, I don’t know if
        <br>
        these new compounds inside the NIBAD, the Non-Invasive Brain Altering
        <br>
        Device, are working, but I can’t really voice my opinion without the
        <br>
        risk of being removed from the project. As the head caretaker of
        <br>
        VS-0945, I’ll leave an update here when any new information comes to
        <br>
        light.
        <br>
        <br>
        5 August 2008
        <br>
        Subject VS-0945 has been undergoing pre-experiment analysis and has
        <br>
        spent quite a lot of time in recreational room 2A. I’ve noticed that
        <br>
        they’ve grown quite attached to Subject PL-0002, and they have told
        <br>
        me on multiple occasions that they have become friends. PL-0002 has
        <br>
        always been reclusive ever since they arrived here, so I think it’s
        <br>
        nice that they and VS-0945 have grown together. The only problem is
        <br>
        that PL-0002 is beginning experimentation tomorrow. I just hope
        <br>
        nothing bad happens.
        <br>
        <br>
        7 August 2008
        <br>
        PL-0002 didn’t survive the experiment. A severe hemorrhage caused by
        <br>
        the experimental compounds administered by the NIBAD led to brain
        <br>
        death only twenty minutes after the hemorrhage was spotted by
        <br>
        Assistant Researcher Andrews. I’ve been panicking for the past two
        <br>
        hours... What do I tell VS-0945? They’ve been so happy talking to
        <br>
        PL-0002, what will they do without them?... I might have an idea.
        <br>
        <br>
        19 August 2008
        <br>
        I’m so morally conflicted right now. My idea was to tell VS-0945 that
        <br>
        PL-0002 was still undergoing experiments and to give them a picture
        <br>
        of PL-0002 to talk to. They bought it a little too well. They haven’t
        <br>
        left their room in a week. They haven’t talked to anyone else but
        <br>
        that picture and me. It’s weighing on me mentally. What do I do?
        <br>
        <br>
        22 August 2008
        <br>
        VS-0945 has been asking me about PL-0002 for the past few days now.
        <br>
        I’ve just kept telling them that they are undergoing experiments, but
        <br>
        I don’t know how long I can keep this going until I break. VS-0945
        <br>
        will go into their experiment tomorrow. I hope that keeps me
        <br>
        distracted, at least for a little bit.
        <br>
        <br>
        24 August 2008
        <br>
        I can hear their screams through the walls. I don’t know if the
        <br>
        compounds are working; the researchers won’t tell me anything. You
        <br>
        know, in all the time that I’ve been on this program, I’ve never
        <br>
        grown attached to any subjects. But this one… this one’s different.
        <br>
        I’m going to pause these logs for a while. I need a break.
        <br>
        <br>
        27 August 2008
        <br>
        I’m coming back here to describe an accident that occurred the other
        <br>
        day during VS-0945’s experiment. The NIBAD misfired while the
        <br>
        researchers were... assisting VS-0945 into the restraints and its beam
        <br>
        entered the subject’s frontal lobe. Due to the setting currently set,
        <br>
        her frontal lobe was shrunk. I’ve almost immediately noticed a change
        <br>
        in their behavior. Beforehand, VS-0945 was a bright young girl, but
        <br>
        now she acts more like a rebellious teenager. If I notice anything
        <br>
        else, I will update this log.
        <br>
        <br>
        1 September 2008
        <br>
        VS-0945’s experiment has come to a close. Luckily, besides the
        <br>
        accident described previously, no other incidents have occurred. I
        <br>
        will continue to monitor VS-0945 for any changes. On a different
        <br>
        note, VS-0945 has continued to talk to the picture of PL-0002. She
        <br>
        still asks me about PL-0002. I think I’m going to have to tell her
        <br>
        soon.
        <br>
        <br>
        4 September 2008
        <br>
        I’ve been having terrible nightmares recently. My husband has had to
        <br>
        shake me awake because I’m yelling and pleading in my sleep for help.
        <br>
        PL-0002 keeps occupying my mind. VS-0945 keeps occupying my mind. I’m
        <br>
        going to tell her tomorrow.
        <br>
        <br>
        5 September 2008
        <br>
        I did it. I told her. She just stared at me in silence until I
        <br>
        quickly left. I couldn’t bear to see the tears forming in her eyes. I
        <br>
        don’t know if I feel better or worse.
        <br>
        <br>
        6 September 2008
        <br>
        I finally got a good night’s sleep for the first time in a while when
        <br>
        I was woken up by a phone call at 2 in the morning. It was the lab.
        <br>
        VS-0945 was gone. There was no sign of escape or tampering, but the
        <br>
        cameras in her room were disabled. All of our security doors were
        <br>
        open, as if someone had just waltzed right through our building and
        <br>
        left. Did I cause this? What have I done? I should’ve never gotten
        <br>
        attached to her.
        <br>
        <br>
        8 September 2008
        <br>
        I don’t know why, but ever since last Saturday, people have been
        <br>
        looking at me as if they had seen a ghost. It’s like I’m not meant to
        <br>
        be here. All that is happening is that I’m being transferred to
        <br>
        another department. A bit unfortunate, but I understand why the UDE
        <br>
        is making that happen. I’ll finish out this log in a few days.
        <br>
        <br>
        9 September 2008
        <br>
        Someone broke into my house last night. I awoke to the sound of
        <br>
        shattering glass downstairs. I had to shake my husband awake, since
        <br>
        he didn't wake up from the sound. We both slowly exited our bedroom and
        <br>
        flicked on the stairway light. I went downstairs first and flicked on
        <br>
        all of the lights I could. No one was in the house. All I found was
        <br>
        a broken kitchen window and an open back door. The intruder must
        <br>
        have left when they heard us wake up. Who could it have been?
        <br>
        <br>
        12 September 2008
        <br>
        Someone broke in again. What is going on? We're going to have to spend
        <br>
        all of our savings on window repairs...
        <br>
        <br>
        13 September 2008
        <br>
        Again. What is happening?
        <br>
        <br>
        14 September 2008
        <br>
        I'm staying up later now. I'm trying to see if I can catch whoever is
        <br>
        doing this. I will find out.
        <br>
        <br>
        28 September 2008
        <br>
        I've been hearing things that aren't there. I've been seeing things
        <br>
        that aren't there. I can't sleep. I <i>can't</i> sleep.
        <br>

        I talked to Dr. [REDACTED] today. He told me he knows how I can
        <br>
        finally sleep. I can finally sleep. Goodnight.
