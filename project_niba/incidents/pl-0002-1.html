        INCIDENT REPORT PL-0002-1 - 7 August 2008
        <br>
        written and compiled by Dr. [REDACTED].
        <br>
        <br>
        DESCRIPTION OF EVENT
        <br>
        At 13:05, fifteen minutes into the first experiment of PL-0002
        <br>
        (henceforth referred to as Subject), restraints were properly secured
        <br>
        to the Subject. The NIBAD (henceforth referred to as Device) was
        <br>
        powered on and loaded with the experimental compound VORDER-2. At
        <br>
        13:07, the Device was fired into the frontal lobe of the Subject.
        <br>
        The Subject began to scream violently and was thrashing about,
        <br>
        seemingly in an attempt to remove the restraints around their arms
        <br>
        and legs. At 13:09, reporters inside of the testing chamber noted
        <br>
        profuse sweating and bloodshot eyes from the Subject, but made no
        <br>
        comment to Dr. Conners, head researcher of Experiment PL-0002-1.
        <br>
        At 13:12, the Device was powered down, and the observation team was
        <br>
        monitoring the Subject's brain for any sign of change. It was at this
        <br>
        time that assistant researcher Dr. Andrews raised the alarm of the
        <br>
        brain hemorrhage in the Subject's prefrontal cortex. A medical team
        <br>
        was immediately rushed in at 13:13 and took five minutes to
        <br>
        remove the restraints around the Subject. The Subject died to
        <br>
        their injuries at 13:28 in the east medical unit.
        <br>
        <br>
        CAUSE OF INCIDENT
        <br>
        Many of the researchers on the Experiment PL-0002-1 team have
        <br>
        proposed the theory that the compound used in the NIBAD during the
        <br>
        experiment was improperly proportioned. According to Dr. Conners, he
        <br>
        believes that the compound was too thick, which made the normally
        <br>
        harmless beam produced by the Device do physical damage to the blood
        <br>
        vessels inside the Subject's brain. When questioned, Dr. Andrews
        <br>
        agreed with this theory, but she also added that the NIBAD might
        <br>
        have been miscalibrated or not calibrated at all before the
        <br>
        experiment commenced, leading to an overdose of compound VORDER-2.
        <br>
        <br>
        OUTCOME OF INCIDENT
        <br>
        The Subject's corpse has been disposed of accordingly following
        <br>
        Protocol 45-A. All members apart of Experiment PL-0002-1 have been
        <br>
        terminated according to Protocol 30-F. Their families have been told
        <br>
        the correct information specified in Protocol 30-F-1. The compound
        <br>
        used in the experiment, VORDER-2, has been recalled and will be
        <br>
        disposed of. More research will be conducted to find the correct
        <br>
        frontal lobe solution for use with the Device. All facilities that
        <br>
        were used during Experiment PL-0002-1 have been properly cleaned in
        <br>
        accordance with Protocol 75-B. Further experiments involving the
        <br>
        frontal lobe have been postponed and all PL subjects have been
        <br>
        reclassified as VS or TS subjects.
        <br>
